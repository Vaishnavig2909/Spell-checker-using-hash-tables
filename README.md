# Spell-checker-using-hash-tables
This project aims to implement the hashing concepts from DSA for making a spell checker, though it is not the most efficient way to create a spell checker in comparison to different techniques like tries but still this is a good way to learn how hashing works.
Along with detecting mistakes this code also suggests the most probable correct spelling using Wagner Fisher algorithm which works on the principle of calculating Levensteins distance.
